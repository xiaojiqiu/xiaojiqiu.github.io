  <h1>Beyond Datafied Labor: The Algorithmic Dilemmas and Resistance of Food Delivery Riders</h1>
  <p><strong>By David Qiu</strong></p>

  <h2>1. Introduction</h2>
  <p>In China’s booming platform economy, millions of food delivery riders navigate urban streets daily under algorithmic dispatch systems. Platforms like Meituan and Ele.me have rapidly transformed service delivery and labor organization...</p>

  <h2>2. Literature Review</h2>
  <h3>2.1 Algorithmic Governance and Digital Labor</h3>
  <p>Management through algorithms has become central to the gig economy. In food delivery, software assigns tasks, monitors riders, and disciplines via automated systems...</p>

  <h3>2.2 Operations Research and Delivery Algorithms</h3>
  <p>Delivery platforms use optimization algorithms based on the Vehicle Routing Problem (VRP). These models aim to minimize delivery time and cost while handling real-time constraints...</p>

  <h2>3. Data and Methodology</h2>
  <p>This study uses mixed methods: surveys (n=83), ethnographic observation, and document analysis in Shenzhen. We gathered rider perspectives on algorithmic control, work intensity, and safety...</p>

  <h2>4. Empirical Results</h2>
  <h3>4.1 Algorithmic Control, Efficiency, and Labor Precarity</h3>
  <p>While algorithmic dispatch increases efficiency, it also increases stress and danger. Over half of riders admit to traffic violations due to time pressure. Gamification exacerbates competition and burnout...</p>

  <h3>4.2 Riders’ Counter-Mapping and Algorithmic Resistance</h3>
  <p>Riders have developed hand-drawn “mutual aid maps” to bypass algorithmic blind spots. These counter-maps reflect lived urban knowledge and represent a form of resistance and community building...</p>

  <h2>5. Discussion</h2>
  <h3>5.1 Integrating Local Knowledge</h3>
  <p>We propose “experience-informed optimization,” where rider feedback dynamically adjusts routing algorithms. This participatory approach can improve performance and labor trust...</p>

  <h3>5.2 Policy Implications and Worker Empowerment</h3>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Algorithm Transparency</strong>: Platforms should explain order and rating systems.</li>
    <li><strong>Rider Autonomy</strong>: Let riders choose orders and routes based on real-world knowledge.</li>
    <li><strong>Labor Protections</strong>: Enforce minimum pay, social insurance, and support for organizing.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>6. Conclusion</h2>
  <p>Food delivery platforms must balance efficiency with human agency. Riders are not just data points but spatial experts. Incorporating their voice can help build a fairer, more sustainable platform ecosystem.</p>
